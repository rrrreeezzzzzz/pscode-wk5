// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

x + y = z
print z


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

If a number is a multiple of 2, except for the number 1, then the number is even. If the number is a multiple of 3, except for the number 1, then the number is odd.


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are


INPUT 1,2,3,4,5
ADD 1+2+3+4+5 to get n
OUTPUT n
n/5=f
IF 1 is minimum of the five numbers
OUTPUT b
IF 5 is maximum of the five numbers
OUTPUT C
f is the average of the numbers (1,2,3,4,5), so f=3
1 is the minimum of the five numbers, so b=1
5 is the maximum of the five numbers, so c=5
